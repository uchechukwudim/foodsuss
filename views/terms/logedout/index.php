                        Any information that you provide to enri   is subject to our Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of your information. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by enri  . As part of providing you the enri   Services, we may need to provide certain communications to you, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your enri   account.

                    <h2>Content Sharing and Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        All the content and information that you share on enri belongs to you.<br>
                        1.	For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with enri    (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.
                        2.	When you delete IP content, it is deleted and it will not be available to use again or available for others to see
                        3.	When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others have shared with you.  We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.  
                        4.	When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of enri, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).
                        5.	We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about enri, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).

                    <p>
                        enri users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:
                        1.	You will not provide any false personal information on enri, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.
                        2.	You will not create more than one personal account.
                        3.	If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our permission.
                        4.	You will not use your personal timeline primarily for your own commercial gain, and will use a enri restaurant Page for such purposes.
                        5.	You will not use enri if you are under 12.
                        6.	You will not use enri if you are a convicted sex offender.

                        10.	If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).


                        6.Protecting Other Peopleâ€™s right 

                        We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.

                        2.	We can remove any content or information you post on enri if we believe that it violates this Statement or our policies.
                        3.	If we remove your content for infringing someone else's copyright, and you believe we removed it by mistake, we will provide you with an opportunity to appeal.
                        4.	If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate.
                        5.	You will not use our copyrights or trademarks (including enri, the enri and e Logos), or any confusingly similar marks, except as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
                        6.	If you collect information from users, you will: obtain their consent, make it clear you (and not enri) are the one collecting their information, and post a privacy policy explaining what information you collect and how you will use it.
                        7.	You will not tag users or send email invitations to non-users without their consent.
